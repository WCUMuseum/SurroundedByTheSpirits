      <h1 style={{paddingLeft: '25px'}}>About this project:</h1>
      <p>This website plays a pivotal role within the Oral History application designed for the Paul Stoller Annex, a prominent component of the Surrounded by the Spirits exhibition, supervised by <a href="http://www.michaeldigiovine.com/">Professor Michael Di Giovine</a> housed in West Chester University's Old Library. The exhibition itself centers around the remarkable contributions of Dr. Paul Stoller to the West African Songhay community.</p>

      <p>To capture the essence of Dr. Stoller's work and convey its significance, a series of comprehensive Oral History interviews were conducted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maclaren-macleod-remy/">Maclaren Remy,</a> a senior History major with a passion for Anthropology. Over the course of four engaging sessions conducted via Zoom, Maclaren delved deep into the experiences, insights, and research of Dr. Stoller, unearthing valuable narratives that shed light on the West African Songhay community's cultural richness and traditions.</p>
      <p>Once the extensive interviews were complete, the task of transforming the raw footage into digestible content fell to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-n-warren-03b216176/">Harrison Warren </a> , a graduate in Urban & Environmental Planning with expertise in video editing. Harrison meticulously curated and edited the recorded videos, skillfully extracting key moments and crafting shorter clips that captured the essence of Dr. Stoller's knowledge and experiences. These carefully crafted clips were then uploaded to YouTube, ensuring that the insights and stories shared by Dr. Stoller would reach a broader audience.</p>
      <p>To further enhance the accessibility and educational impact of the project, <a href="https://maysur.github.io/Resume/index.html">Mayur Suresh,</a> a Computer Science graduate, took on the task of developing this webpage using the versatile and user-friendly React framework. Mayur created an innovative digital solutions allowed for the creation of an engaging and immersive online platform.

      <p>Through the collaborative efforts of Maclaren Remy, Harrison Warren , and Mayur Suresh, this website has become an invaluable resource. It captures the essence of Dr. Stoller's work, preserves the Oral History interviews, and presents them in a captivating and informative way.
